# Football Match Prediction Using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that predicts football match outcomes using historical match data. The complete workflow — from data analysis to model evaluation — is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting football match results (Home Win / Draw / Away Win) using machine learning techniques. Historical match data is analyzed, processed, and used to train ML models that can estimate future match outcomes.

## 🧠 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Machine learning model training
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Match outcome prediction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

📊 Workflow

Load historical football match data

Clean and preprocess the dataset

Perform feature engineering

Train machine learning models

Evaluate performance using metrics

Predict match outcomes

📈 Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision & Recall (if applicable)

## 📌 Future Improvements

Use more advanced models (XGBoost, Neural Networks)

Add real-time data scraping

Improve feature engineering

Deploy as a web application
